# Machine-Learning-Customer-Segmentation
In this project I tried to work on Unsupervised Learning.
**Unsupervised Learning :** Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function that describes the structure of "unlabeled" data.

I have not included any save files , you need to execute each and every line to produce all the files needed and then segment the data.<br>
In this case study we are given a dataset which has transaction level information.<br>
Eg. If a customer goes and buys 4 products like eggs,milk,apples and bananas then this data is divided into 4 parts where each part consists of the invoice no.,customer Id,StockCode,Description,Quantity,InvoiceDate,UnitPrice and Country.<br>
Now we need to convert these transaction level information into customer level transaction and in the process of doing so we need to do some feature engineering which will give more information to our model.<br>
The input dataset is located in Files folder.
